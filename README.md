# RefugeMe
### HackTheChange2022
## Inspiration
We initially drew inspiration from the UN global issues [https://www.un.org/en/global-issues]. Given the recent political issues in the East, we have also withnessed many call-to-action that aims to help refugees escape the Russo-Ukrainian War.

## What it does
Our website is an Airbnb-like platform for refugee who are looking for the closest, safest or most-welcoming home to shelter themselves. We match each user to host families based on basic features like: country and language used.

## How we built it
We made the website using:

<li> ReactJS for front-end </li>

<li> NodeJS and Express for back-end </li>

<li> MUI, Boostrap, and CSS for styling </li>
